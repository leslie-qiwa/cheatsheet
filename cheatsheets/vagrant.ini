forces reprovisioning of the vagrant machine = vagrant provision
connects to machine via SSH = vagrant ssh
stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine = vagrant destroy
Get the vagrant version = vagrant -v
outputs status of all vagrant machines = vagrant global-status
same as above, but prunes invalid entries = vagrant global-status --prune

Resume a suspended machine (vagrant up works just fine for this as well) = vagrant resume
Restart the virtual machine and force provisioning = vagrant reload --provision
Use the debug flag to increase the verbosity of the output = vagrant provision --debug
Yes, vagrant can be configured to deploy code! = vagrant push
